## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```typescript
// Example component structure
interface PropertyCardProps {
  property: Property
  onFavoriteToggle: (id: string) => void
  locale: 'en' | 'zh-hk'
}

export function PropertyCard({ 
  property, 
  onFavoriteToggle, 
  locale 
}: PropertyCardProps) {
  const t = useTranslations('property')
  
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### CSS Architecture
```css
/* Tailwind custom classes */
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-yellow-400 hover:bg-yellow-500 text-gray-900 font-medium py-2 px-4 rounded-lg transition-colors;
  }
  
  .btn-secondary {
    @apply bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-medium py-2 px-4 rounded-lg transition-colors;
  }
}
```

### API Route Structure
```typescript
// app/api/properties/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const location = searchParams.get('location')
  const checkIn = searchParams.get('checkIn')
  
  // Implementation
  return NextResponse.json({ properties })
}
```
